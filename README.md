# ISOLDE
Here you can find the materials for the practical exercises and demonstrations of the Computational Modelling tutorial at ISOLDE 2018 in Potsdam. 

### How to complete the practical exercises and demos?

There are two options to complete the exercises and run the demos.

*Option 1: Offline, using Anaconda (or similar)*

1. Download Anaconda (which contains all parts of python you will need and more): 
https://www.anaconda.com/download/
(Graphical installer available for Windows and iOS, no admin rights necessary, all scripts have been tested with python 3.6)  
2. Download this repository (button top left: download zip) and unpack it.    
3. Open Anaconda, launch jupyter
4. A browser should open, navigate in the browser to the directory where you saved the extracted files
5. Open the notebooks (a new tab will appear), they are the files ending with ".ipynb"

For the statistical learning exercise, the "solutions" are in the file "bigram_model_ref.py"

*Option 2: Online, using mybinder*

1. Open this link in your browser: [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/christinabergmann/ISOLDE/master)
2. Open the notebooks (a new tab will appear), they are the files ending with ".ipynb"


**Note**: Your edits will not be saved, download the file to keep your changes to it.
