    "\n",
    "We use data from the wordbank project, downloaded via http://wordbank.stanford.edu/ and from the Brent Corpus of North American English child directed speech, which is available on CHILDES (https://childes.talkbank.org/).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Reading in the vocabulary data from wordbank and reading in the input data from the Brent corpus\n",
    "2. Extract words according to different rationales (raw frequency, position in a sentence) so that we get an ordered list\n",
    "3. Correlate the extracted predictor words and the learned words (and make sure to only compare words for with we have both acquisition and input data)"
